## Task

---

We have a request from a client to write the software to control the flow of planes at an airport. The planes can land and take off provided that the weather is sunny. Occasionally it may be stormy, in which case no planes can land or take off. Here are the user stories that we worked out in collaboration with the client:

## User Stories

[User Story 3 : Prevent takeoff when weather is stormy] (#U3)
[User Story 4 : Prevent landing when weather is stormy] (#U4)
[User Story 5 : Prevent landing when the airport is full] (#U5)
[User Story 6 : Overridden default airport capacity] (#U6)#
